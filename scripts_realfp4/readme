python version 3.11.10 would work fine.

the cuda & triton environment should be as follow: 
https://github.com/triton-lang/triton
please strictly follow triton environment setup in this website

CUDA 12.8 should be installed

use real_fp4_350m.sh to run 

there should be some bugs to be fixed, in file ./utils/real_fp4_quantization.py
